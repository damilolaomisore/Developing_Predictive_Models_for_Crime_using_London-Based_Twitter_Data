# Developing_Predictive_Models_for_Crime_using_London-Based_Twitter_Data
The research aimed to uncover hidden relationships and early warning signs of criminal activity by analyzing patterns of retweets and likes associated with specific keywords related to crime.
The advent of social media has revolutionized communication patterns and interaction among people, leading to vast amounts of user-generated data. This data, particularly from platforms like Twitter, has become a valuable resource for scholars and data scientists seeking new analysis and forecasting methods. In this context, the study examines the feasibility of employing Twitter activity to predict crime in metropolitan areas, focusing on London as a case study. The objectives include collecting and preprocessing Twitter data, analyzing Twitter behaviors and crime patterns, and developing a crime prediction model.
The study compared the performance of four models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. Each model's accuracy, Kappa value, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting crime. The Random Forest model emerged as the most promising, achieving an accuracy of 80.31% and demonstrating a strong ability to differentiate between low and high crime occurrences.
The study acknowledges potential limitations related to biases in social media data and data quality issues. While the findings showcase the potential of utilizing Twitter data for crime prediction, the study also highlights areas for future research. These include addressing data biases, exploring temporal dynamics, enhancing interpretability of models, and considering ethical implications related to privacy and bias. Ultimately, the research contributes valuable insights into the use of machine learning and social media data for crime prediction, with the Random Forest model showing promise for practical application in crime prevention and response strategies.
